# Changelog

## 2.1.0

Embed full 280-charater tweets, not the 140-character bc version. Twitter cuts these off with an ellipsis in a way that can be unattractive and the user went out of their way to embed the tweet so presumably they want the whole thing. 280 characters has been the standard for quite a while now.

## 2.0.0-2.0.5

Initial release, bug fixes, simpler regular expressions, circleci testing
